# Express Authentication and File Upload with Security Best Practices

## Project Overview

This project is a Node.js application built using Express, designed to handle user registration, login, and file uploads. The application emphasizes cybersecurity best practices, including password hashing, secure file handling, and JWT-based authentication. The project is structured to be easily extensible and maintainable.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Secure user registration with email validation.
- **User Login**: JWT-based authentication with secure session management.
- **File Upload**: Secure file upload with type and size restrictions.
- **Middleware Protection**: Authentication middleware to protect routes.
- **CSRF Protection**: Integrated CSRF protection for form submissions.
- **Security Headers**: HTTP headers set using Helmet to protect against common vulnerabilities.
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for routes and middleware using Mocha, Chai, and Supertest.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **MySQL** (v5.7 or higher)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-auth-upload-security.git
   cd express-auth-upload-security
Install dependencies:

bash
Salin kode
npm install
Set up the MySQL database:

Create a new database:
sql
Salin kode
CREATE DATABASE express_auth;
Configure the database connection in the .env file:
bash
Salin kode
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=express_auth
Run database migrations:

To create the required tables:
bash
Salin kode
npm run migrate
Start the server:

bash
Salin kode
npm start
The server will start at http://localhost:3000.

Run tests:

To run the unit tests:
bash
Salin kode
npm test
Assumptions
JWT Token Handling: JWT tokens are stored as HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks.
File Uploads: Only specific file types (png, jpg, jpeg, pdf) are allowed, and the maximum file size is set to 16MB.
Security: Basic security practices such as input validation, password hashing, CSRF protection, and secure headers are assumed to be sufficient for typical web applications.
Design Rationales
Separation of Concerns: The application separates concerns by organizing the code into different modules (models, routes, middleware). This makes the code more maintainable and scalable.
Use of ES Modules: The project uses ES modules to keep up with modern JavaScript standards. This decision also aligns with future-proofing the application.
Middleware for Security: Authentication and CSRF protection are implemented as middleware to ensure that security checks are consistently applied across relevant routes.
Testing: Unit tests are written to cover critical parts of the application, including authentication, file upload, and middleware logic.
Areas of Potential Improvement
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints.
Enhanced Logging: Integrate a robust logging system (e.g., Winston) to log security-relevant events such as failed login attempts.
User Roles and Permissions: Extend the application to support user roles (e.g., admin, user) and permissions to provide more granular access control.
Improved Error Handling: Implement a centralized error handling mechanism to manage and log different types of errors systematically.
Session Management: Consider using a more secure session management strategy, such as rotating JWT tokens and implementing session expiration.
Input Sanitization: Further enhance input sanitization to protect against injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection).
Continuous Integration: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate tests and deploy the
